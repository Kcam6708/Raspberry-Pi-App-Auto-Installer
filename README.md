# Raspberry-Pi-App-Auto-Installer
This line of code will install the apps you need to start with Raspberry Pi OS.
I will keep the list updated as much as possible.
If you have any ideas let me know. 
Copy and paste the following into a terminal on your Raspberry Pi an the apps will install.



sudo apt install gparted -y && sudo apt install rpi-imager -y && sudo apt install neofetch -y && sudo apt install transmission -y && sudo apt install xrdp -y && wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bot... | bash && curl -sSL https://git.io/JfAPE | bash && sudo apt install kde-plasma-desktop && sudo apt install mypaint && sudo apt install qmmp && sudo apt install deluged deluge-console python-mako deluge-web && sudo apt install openvpn sudo apt install steamlink && 



Many thanks to the developers of these apps.
